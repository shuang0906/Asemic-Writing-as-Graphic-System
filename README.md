# Asemic-Writing-as-Graphic-System
This project is a computational experiment that turns the graphical properties of writing into a coherent graphic system. Written in Python, it sets rules for how individual glyphs are formed and how they are sequenced on the page, generating asemic shapes whose readability resides in form rather than meaning.
