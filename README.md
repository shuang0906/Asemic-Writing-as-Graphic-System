# Asemic Writing as Graphic System

This project is a computational experiment that turns the graphical properties of writing into a coherent graphic system. Written in Python, it sets rules for how individual glyphs are formed and how they are sequenced on the page, generating asemic shapes whose readability resides in form rather than meaning.

The work is presented as a book that documents the system: each spread states a rule and shows its visual output, so the procedure is clear at a glance. Printing anchors the ephemeral computation in a durable object that can be handled and read, embodying writing as the material act of trace-making.

Attribution — Code in this project is partially based on materials from Allison Parrish’s class Computational Letterforms and Layout at NYU ITP. See the course syllabus at https://cll.decontextualize.com/ for context.
